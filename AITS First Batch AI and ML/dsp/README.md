# Smart Security using Artificial Intelligence

Smart Secutity using Artificial Intelligence through OpenCv in Python

### Prerequisites

Anaconda(Download from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

TensorFlow

Keras

OpenCv

### Installing

Install Anaconda from the above link

After installing Anaconda...

Install TensorFlow via "Anaconda Prompt" : conda install TensorFlow

Install Keras via "Anaconda Prompt" : conda install Keras

Install OpenCv via "Anaconda Prompt" : conda install OpenCv

### Starting with Project

1. Create a Folder and name it "dataset".

2. Create 2 Sub Folders and name them "test_set" and "training_set".

3. Create 2 more sub folders in both the folders which are created in step 2 and name them as "allowed" and "not_allowed".

4. Finally the tree will look like

5. Now Collect the Image(s) of 2 person(s). Divide them in 4:1 ratio in the format of Training_set : Test_set.

6. Place 80% of First Person's Images in "training_set --> allowed" and 20% of the Same person's images in "test_set --> allowed".

7. Place 80% of Second Person's Images in "training_set --> not_allowed" and 20% of the Same person's images in "test_set --> not_allowed".

8. Open "Jupyter Notebook" and open the "CNN.ipynb" file and in 11th cell, make sure your path is set correct.

9. Make a note of the results which are generated by running the 11th cell.

10. Now goto 13th Cell and Change the "samples_per_epoch" to the value which is produced in the first line of 11th cell and "nb_val_samples" to the value which is produced in the second line of 11th cell.

11. Run every cell one after the other and wait for completion of all epochs at the 13th cell(Usually it will take a very long time).

12. After completion of all the epochs... save the result to a ".h5" file using "model.save()", pass the name as per you want in 14 th cell.

### Predicting Results

1. Open "CNN Prediction.ipynb" file.

2. Change the "h5" file name to your file name at "model =load_model('******.h5')".

3. In the 4th Cell make sure your Test image path is set correct.

4. Now run the "CNN Prediction.ipynb" file. you'll get result as either 0 or 1. 0 represents Allowed and 1 represents not allowed.
